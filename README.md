# Covid-19 NTNU Simulation Model
## Master thesis project

This repository includes the code I am working on for my master thesis on NTNU, spring 2021, in the course TBT4900.  
The code is an object oriented version of the original code found in https://github.com/andrevo/covid19-ntnu.


The main model can be found in `model.py`, with supporting model functions in `modelFunctions.py` and `modelUtilities.py`, and classes used in the `classes.py`. The `parameters.py` include the default parameters used in the simulations. 

To fascilitate analysis, plotting and network creation, several supporting functions can be found in `analysis.py`, `network.py` and `simulationProgram.py`.
